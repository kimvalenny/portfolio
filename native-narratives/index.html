          <h1>What is Native Narratives?</h1>
          <p>
            In 2019/2020, Australia was tragically affected by a period of
            unusually intense bushfires â€“ colloquially known as Black Summer.
            These wildfires were detrimental to the Australian wildlife and
            threatened species such as glossy black cockatoos, kangaroos, and
            koalas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over 60,000 koalas were impacted by this bushfire crisis and thus,
            the <span class="project-name">Native Narratives</span> team believe
            it is imperative to raise environmental awareness amongst young
            children.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inspired by the devastation caused by these events,
            <span class="project-name">Native Narratives</span> is a team that
            has written and illustrated a children's book that follows the story
            of Kiki the Koala during the Australian bushfires.
          </p>
          <p>
            In accordance with the RSPCA Provocation goals,
            <span class="project-name">Native Narratives</span>
            aims to foster a strong sense of environmental and animal welfare in
            the young people of society. By achieving this, primary school aged
            children will ultimately be more educated and subsequently and more
            inspired to make a difference as they grow up. We also aim to raise
            awareness about the travesties of climate change and provide calls
            to action that allow people to make a difference within their own
            capacity.

          <h1>The creative process</h1>
          <p>
            This idea was formed as a result of intensive ideating sessions.
            Once we decided on a children's book, we were able to brainstorm the
            most effective way of incorporating the RSPCA and the provocation
            aims. As passionate environmentalists, we saw it very fitting to
            explore the direction of climate change and the detriment that it
            can cause to wildlife.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team came together with a vast range of skill sets. Each team
            member was allocated a specific job in which we have spent the
            semester focusing on to complete the project together. For example,
            some of the team were assigned writing tasks, whereas others were
            responsible for illustrations. This allowed us to excel at what we
            were confident in and enabled us to produce a final copy to the best
            of our specialised abilities.

          <h3>So what's next?</h3>
          <p>
            In the future,
            <span class="project-name">Native Narratives</span> aspires to
            extend our children's book line and delve into the stories of Tommy
            the Turtle, Kate the Kangaroo and Chloe the Cockatoo.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the meantime, Kiki the Koala and her experience of the Australian
            bushfires remains as the focus - and her story in the
            <span class="project-name">Native Narratives</span> series can be
            read here!
