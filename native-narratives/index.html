          <h1>What is Native Narratives?</h1>
          <p>
            RSPCA Queensland has the largest and busiest Wildlife Hospital in the state, providing care to over 26,000 native animals every year. There are many factors that impact our native animals: natural disasters such as bushfire and droughts, dog attacks, road accidents and habitat loss.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every year our RSPCA Animal Ambulances attend nearly 30,000 rescue call outs for sick, injured or orphaned wildlife. Over half of the animals that came into RSPCA in 2021 were native animals treated in our Wildlife Hospital.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project, written and illustrated by the
            <span id="project-name">Native Narratives</span> team, is an illustrated childrenâ€™s book. Our first novel follows the journey of Kiki the Koala and how the RSPCA helped her overcome the travesty of the Australian bushfires.
          </p>
          <p>
            With intentions of targeting primary school children, the book also
            consists of information about the RSPCA in relation to their care of
            Australian wildlife, as well as a call to action that enables the
            reader to follow the correct avenues if they see injured animals.
            The RSPCA will be entirely transparent with the allocation of all
            proceeds, allowing the buyer/reader to see and understand the impact
            they have by purchasing the book.
          </p>
          <p>
            The book will be focusing on emotional appeals to the audience to
            sympathize with the wildlife and how their lives have been affected
            by various circumstances. It also includes emotive language such as
            similes, metaphors and strong adjectives that can be used as
            teaching devices.
